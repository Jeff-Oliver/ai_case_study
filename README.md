Through the use of AI, Enlitic is creating a framework of applications to standardize healthcare imaging data and improve provider workloads and patient outcomes.

## Business Activities



>A New Paradigm in Healthcare Data Standards
>
>Standards exist today (DICOM, HL7, FHIR…) that would allow the medical images from different facilities to be combined into a common data platform, like a VNA. Unfortunately, that does nothing to solve the ability to gain insights into that data as there are likely, no data governance structures in place that would enable a system to gather insights about all this data in one place. Different terminology, different naming structures and more diversity of data prevents adequate analysis of this data.
>
>Ensight introduces data governance capabilities and deidentification and anonymization tools to solve decades old challenges and move your organization towards the real-world evidence database we need.
>
>Enlitic is building a data framework that applies data governance as a critical first step towards consolidating a valuable data source from medical images. We are addressing challenges that impact the ability to create value from your existing data.<sup id="f6">6</sup>

Enlitic leverages multiple AI technologies including computer vision, natural language processing and deep learning.<sup id="f7">7</sup><sup >, </sup><sup id="f7">8</sup>

>"Ensight integrates the ENDEX™ data standardization module and the ENCOG™ anonymization module into a unified software framework coupled with key infrastructural components required to deliver the planned common data mode"<sup id="f9">9</sup>


## Landscape

>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the field of healthcare imaging. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions has led to significant advancements in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.   
>
>Key areas of impact include:
>
> * __Disease detection and diagnosis:__ AI algorithms can analyze medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, to detect abnormalities that may be missed by human radiologists. This can lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment.   
> * __Image analysis and quantification:__ AI can automatically measure and quantify features within medical images, providing more accurate and consistent assessments. This is particularly useful in areas like oncology, where precise measurements are critical for treatment planning and monitoring.   
> * __Treatment planning:__ AI can help optimize treatment plans based on patient-specific factors, such as tumor size, location, and surrounding anatomy. This can improve treatment outcomes and reduce side effects.   
> * __Workflow efficiency:__ AI can streamline the imaging workflow by automating tasks like image routing, prioritization, and reporting. This can reduce turnaround times and improve patient satisfaction.   
>__Specific examples of AI applications in healthcare imaging include:__
>
> * __Cancer detection:__ AI algorithms have been shown to outperform human radiologists in detecting breast cancer, lung cancer, and other types of malignancies.   
Bone fracture assessment: AI can accurately identify and classify bone fractures, even in complex cases.   
> * __Brain tumor segmentation:__ AI can automatically segment brain tumors from surrounding tissue, aiding in surgical planning and radiation therapy.   
> * __Cardiac analysis:__ AI can analyze heart images to detect abnormalities such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias. 
>  
>While the potential benefits of AI in healthcare imaging are significant, there are also challenges to be addressed, such as data privacy, algorithm bias, and the need for regulatory oversight. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in improving patient care and outcomes.
